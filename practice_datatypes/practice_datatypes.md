##Practice Basic Javascript! Data types, variables, arrays

### Open Chrome console, and go wild!!!!

- Create a variable, what happens when you do not assign the variable a value?
// Undefined
- Now, assign the variable a value
        **make sure you try assigning all primitive data-types**
//
- Test typeof, with the variable you created, try it for all data-types
//null, string, number
Now try this:
```
"carrot" - "car"
//doesn't work

6 - 3
//3

 try this:
```
3 + 5

"tea" + "pot"
//teapot
### Lets play with some in-built methods

Try this in your console:
```
"hello".length
//5

3.length
//invalid

### Play around with this some more, check this **[tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)** out.

## Arrays

### Independent Practice
Create an array of your favorite sports teams and test out some different methods on that array. 

*    `Array.push()`
*    `Array.pop()`
*    `Array.shift()`
*    `Array.unshift()`
*    `Array.sort()`
*    `Array.reverse()`

Here is a reference for more information about [arrays and methods you can use on them](http://devdocs.io/javascript-array/).

### Independent Practice Round Two!
Those six array methods that you just practiced are all very important, but they're not the only methods you will be using! Here's another round of very common and useful array methods that are beneficial to learn:

* `String.split()`
//splits a string using a defined separator
* `Array.join()`
// var varx = array.join(insertswhateverisherebetweenarraystrings);
* `Array.splice()`
//check http://devdocs.io/javascript-array/
used to remove any element of an array, in any position, and also add a new element in a defined position
* `Array.slice()`

After you feel like you have a good understanding of those four methods, check out [this reference](http://devdocs.io/javascript-array/) and see if you can find any other methods that you think will be useful and share back with the class!

### White Boarding

Shut your computers.

Let's whiteboard examples of:

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Array
* variable assignment

##Conclusion

* What are the five primitive JavaScript data types?
* What method can be used to remove the last item in an array?
* What method can be used to remove the first item in an array?
* What method can be used to add an item to the end of an array?
* What method can be used to add an item to the beginning of an array?
